functionality:
  - evaluate the profitability of a company in a given month
    - calculate the payRate of a user in a given month
    - partially involved worker that in ProdChainUser
    - history of ProductionChains
    - how do I apply department logic here
    - how do I make history here?
  - create / update user (type of user) / department / tools / product / product chain
  - each month the amount of goods generated will be calculated (or you can configure for any type)
    - user (of different types) with their work hours
    - tools with their configured functions of deterioration
  - different functions can be added like:
    - add 2 users each year
    - fix all tools
    - take credit next month for specified sum
    - pay +20% to all users
  - I think lets remove departments (or leave only for stats) and focus on the moniroting playfield

endpoint:
  - create 3 use cases of how this program can be used
    - one of them is in master -> Проєктний аналіз
  - managing multiple product chains and managing hours of users working on that
  - validate BisFunctions on User edit (what if changes to a type that is unsupported by some BisFunction)
    - also on User type change (what if he is already attached to ProductionChain?)
  - allow null for Credit.startPeriod, User.employedAt
  - production chain, where one product is used for other resources

  - create User dynamically
