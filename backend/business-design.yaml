functionality:
  - evaluate the profitability of a company in a given month
    - calculate the payRate of a user in a given month
    - partially involved worker that in ProdChainUser
    - history of ProductionChains
    - how do I apply department logic here
    - how do I make history here?
  - create / update user (type of user) / department / tools / product / product chain
  - each month the amount of goods generated will be calculated (or you can configure for any type)
    - user (of different types) with their work hours
    - tools with their configured functions of deterioration
  - different functions can be added like:
    - add 2 users each year
    - fix all tools
    - take credit next month for specified sum
    - pay +20% to all users
  - I think lets remove departments (or leave only for stats) and focus on the moniroting playfield

endpoint:
  - create 3 use cases of how this program can be used
    - one of them is in master -> Проєктний аналіз
  - add additional info per each BisFunction
  - add createTreelike
  - add editing of ProductionChain, ProductionChainUser, ProductionChainResource
  - add ability to SPEND money simulating building some project
    - this will allow to predict how much money and when we can invest in building a new project
    - you can do it through ProductionChain with only equipment
    - you can even do fractional investments through buying equpment one by one
  - add ability to change any entity
    - this will allow to change product price
  - auto generated names for bis functions
  - managing multiple product chains and managing hours of users working on that
  - validate BisFunctions on User edit (what if changes to a type that is unsupported by some BisFunction)
    - also on User type change (what if he is already attached to ProductionChain?)
  - allow null for Credit.startPeriod, User.employedAt
  - production chain, where one product is used for other resources

  - statistics of how much was spent during each period

  - create User dynamically

  - how long a company can survive without selling goods
    - produce 2 equipments, resources and users
    - see that not enought money
    - produce only 1 equipments, resources, users
    - see that we can only buy 2 equipment on 202310
    - take credit on 202202, buy equpment on 202202, hire 1 person, buy 2 resources
    - start payout of credit
  - 3 employees, figure out when credit will be paid out
  - buying a house where you invest into stocks, and calculate when you will be able to build it

current-limitations:
  - only one production chain per account. initial production chain is created with seeds, user can edit it but not delete
